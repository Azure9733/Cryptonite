## rev/Three
Approach: 1. File Type
2. reading
3. executing
4. troubleshooting execution
1. File Type: The file was an elf file format
2. Reading: In order to deal with an elf file i looked up online for anything related to elf files.  
I referred to https://medium.com/@ajmewal/basics-of-elf-executable-and-linkable-format-file-88a516877356
3. Executing: The file despite being an executable did not execute.  
Running the file gives no such file exists even though the file is evidently present in the directory

4. troubleshooting execution: Various methods were tried with the reverse engineering team but it did not execute.
   

After the event: 
I referred to the writeup for three. https://ouuan.moe/post/2024/02/dicectf-2024-quals#three  
I was supposed to use IDA. I am still new to reverse engineering thus i did not know how to use it.  
I will definitely get back to this challenge after i have a better understanding.
